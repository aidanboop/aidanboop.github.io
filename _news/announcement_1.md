This is an explanation for Who, What, Where, and Why I made this website for seemingly no reason.

From the moment he could form sentences, Aidan was captivated by the glowing screens and intricate gadgets that seemed to shape the modern world. His fascination with computers and hardware began at an early age when his father, recognizing his innate curiosity, gifted him a personal computer on his seventh birthday. It was an old model by modern standards, but to Aidan, it was a portal to endless possibilities.

At first, Aidan spent hours exploring the computer’s capabilities, installing simple programs, and tinkering with its settings. His true joy, however, came from playing games. The immersive worlds and challenges offered by those games created a safe haven where he could lose himself in creativity and adventure. The computer became his companion, a steady presence through the years that followed.

As time passed, Aidan’s interest in the mechanics of his PC grew. By the age of 12, he was disassembling and reassembling the machine, eager to understand what made it tick. His room transformed into a workshop filled with spare parts, cables, and the occasional circuit board. Friends and family came to him for advice on their own devices, marveling at how such a young boy could diagnose and solve technical problems with ease.

A decade later, Aidan’s passion for technology showed no signs of waning. Determined to turn his interest into a lifelong career, he set his sights on Michigan Technological University, a school renowned for its engineering and technology programs. He initially enrolled in Software Engineering, eager to learn how to build the programs and systems he had admired as a child. Yet, as he delved deeper into his coursework, Aidan discovered a new fascination: Data Science.

Data Science intrigued him with its blend of statistics, programming, and the potential to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of information. By his second semester, Aidan made the bold decision to switch his major. It was a leap of faith, but one that felt right.

His first Data Science class, DATA1201, became a pivotal moment in his academic journey. The class tasked students with building a functional website—an assignment that excited and challenged Aidan in equal measure. He poured his energy into the project, determined to create something unique and engaging.

After weeks of hard work, Aidan unveiled his website. It was a sleek, interactive platform that showcased his love for technology and gaming. The site featured sections dedicated to game reviews, hardware tutorials, and even a blog where he shared tips for budding tech enthusiasts. His professors and peers were impressed not only by the technical proficiency of his work but also by the personal touch he infused into every detail.

Completing the project reinforced Aidan’s decision to pursue Data Science. The satisfaction of combining creativity with technical skill ignited a deeper passion within him. He began to envision a future where he could use his knowledge to solve complex problems, create innovative solutions, and share his love for technology with the world.

As Aidan continued his studies, he remained the same curious and driven boy who once spent hours exploring his childhood PC. His journey was far from over, but he knew he was on the right path—a path that began with a simple gift from his father and had grown into a lifelong pursuit of knowledge and innovation.
