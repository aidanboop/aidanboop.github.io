  **Data Science Student at MTU.**

  *"Every thought we think is creating our future."*

Hi! My name is Aidan Boop.

I'm currently a student at Michigan Technological University pursuing a Bachelors in Data Science. 
This is a final project for my DATA1201 Course. 

A fun fact about me: I have a tattoo of my favorite anime character [Toji Fushiguro](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Toji_Fushiguro), which isn't something you come across often...
